## Installation

### Server Requirements

The Lychee gallery has a few system requirements. You will need to make sure your server has the following:

- A web server such as Apache or nginx
- A database &mdash; using one of the following: 
    - MySQL _(version > 5.7.8)_ / MariaDB _(version > 10.2)_
	- PostgreSQL _(version > 9.2)_
	- Lychee's inbuilt SQLite3 support
- PHP >= 7.4 with these PHP extensions:
    - BCMath
    - Ctype
    - Exif
    - Ffmpeg (optional &mdash; to generate video thumbnails)
    - Fileinfo
    - GD
    - Imagick (optional &mdash; to generate better thumbnails)
    - JSON
    - Mbstring
    - OpenSSL
    - PDO
    - Tokenizer
    - XML
    - ZIP

While Lychee works on 32bit systems, we **strongly** recommend the use of a 64bit OS.

### Installing Lychee

We provide three methods to install Lychee: using a Docker image, the latest release .zip or from source, using Composer.

#### With Docker

Read [here](docker.html).

#### From Release 

Download the release zip-file from the [Releases](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases) page and extract it (usually in `/var/www/html`).
It contains a trimmed down version of the Lychee files.

#### From the Master branch

Lychee utilizes [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies. Make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

```
git clone https://www.github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee /var/www/html/Lychee
```
Get into the directory:
```
cd /var/www/html/Lychee
```
Install the required dependencies.
```
composer install --no-dev
```
If you want to help develop Lychee, install the development dependencies by removing the `--no-dev` or replacing it with --dev.


### Configuration

#### Public Directory
After installing Lychee, configure your web server's root to be the `public` directory. The `index.php` in this directory serves as the interface for all HTTP requests to Lychee's API. Note that the `.env` file should **not** be exposed online as it contains the encryption key used for cookies as well as database credentials.

#### Configuration Files
All of the configuration files for Lychee are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

#### Directory Permissions
After installing Lychee, you need to configure some permissions. Directories within the `storage` and the `bootstrap/cache` directories should be writable by your web server or Lychee will not run. Additionaly `public/uploads`, `public/dist` and `public/sym` need to be writable to upload files, customise the CSS and utilise [symbolic links](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/settings.html#symbolic-link) respectively.

#### Application Key
The next thing you should do after installing Lychee is set your application key to a random string. This is easily done by using the `php artisan key:generate` command.

Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the `.env` environment file. If you have not copied the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`, you should do that now.

**If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!**

#### Additional Configuration
Lychee needs almost no other configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the `config/app.php` file and its documentation. It contains some options that aren't included from `.env` that you may wish to change according to your installation.

You may also want to configure a few additional components of Lychee in `.env`, such as:

- Cache
- Database
- Session

## Web Server Configuration

### General
It is strongly recommented that Lychee is served out of the root of your web server, not a subdirectory.

It is also strongly recommended to serve Lychee over TLS. You may wish to consider [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for certificates and [Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) for server configuration examples.

### Apache

Lychee includes a `public/.htaccess` file that is used to provide URLs without the `index.php` front controller in the path. Before serving Lychee with Apache, be sure to enable the `mod_rewrite` module so the `.htaccess` file will be honored by the server.

If the `.htaccess` file that ships with Lychee does not work with your Apache installation, try this alternative:

```
Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

### Nginx

This is a sample nginx server block. It does not include TLS, but covers the Lychee-specific requirements.

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <mydomain>.<tld>;

##### Path to the Lychee public/ directory.
    root /var/www/lychee/public/;

    # If the request is not for a valid file (image, js, css, etc.), send to bootstrap
    if (!-e $request_filename)
    {
        rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 last;
        break;
    }

    # Serve /index.php through PHP
    location = /index.php {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\.php)(/.*)$;

        # Mitigate https://httpoxy.org/ vulnerabilities
        fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

######### Make sure this is the correct socket for your system
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "post_max_size=100M
            max_execution_time=200
            upload_max_filesize=30M
            memory_limit=300M";
        fastcgi_param PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
    # Deny access to other .php files, rather than exposing their contents
    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) {
        return 403;
    }

    # [Optional] Lychee-specific logs
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/lychee.error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/lychee.access.log;

    # [Optional] Remove trailing slashes from requests (prevents SEO duplicate content issues)
    rewrite ^/(.+)/$ /$1 permanent;
}
```
