## Introduction

In this page we describe additional ways to install and potentially to develop on Lychee.

## Separating Data from the Code

As described in issue #486, LudovicRousseau proposes a solution to separate your photos from the Lychee code.

He splits Lychee itself and the pictures into 2 directories:
- `Lychee` with the code of Lychee
- `Lychee-data` containing:
```
Lychee-data/
└── public
    ├── dist
    │   ├── fonts
    │   └── resources
    └── uploads
        ├── big
        ├── import
        ├── medium
        ├── raw
        ├── small
        └── thumb
```
- his `Lychee/.env` contains:
```ini
LYCHEE_DIST="/var/www/Lychee-data/public/dist/"
LYCHEE_UPLOADS="/var/www/Lychee-data/public/uploads/"
```

> {note} Note that the **path needs to be absolute**.


The upgrade script when a new version of Lychee is available is simple:
```bash
mv Lychee Lychee.old
unzip Lychee.zip
cp Lychee.old/.env Lychee
chmod g+w -R Lychee/storage
sudo chgrp www-data -R Lychee/storage
cd Lychee
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```
It worked fine with the migration from 4.0.4 to 4.0.5 of Lychee.

The hierarchy `Lychee-data/public/` is writeable by the group `www-data` so that apache process can modify the files.
The files in `Lychee` are read only for apache. No write access needed.


## VirtualBox with Visual Studio Code

- Requires an Apache server with `proxy` and `proxy_http` enabled.
- Requires a Virtual Machine (using e.g. VirtualBox)

### Set Up & Port Forwarding

Set up your VM as if you would install any server.

Set up the following port forwarding:

- `host:10180` &Rarr; `guest:80`
- `host:10122` &Rarr; `guest:22`

The first one will allow us to access the server from Local host, the second will allow us to connect to it via SSH.

### Apache and Proxy in the Host

Edit your `/etc/hosts` to contain:
```
127.0.0.1	lychee.test
127.0.0.1	lycheeorg.test
```

Create configuration files in `/etc/apache2/sites-available`: `001-lychee-test.conf` and `002-lycheeorg-test.conf`

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName lychee.test

	ProxyPass / http://localhost:10180/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://lychee.test/
	ProxyPreserveHost On
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
and
```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName lycheeorg.test

	ProxyPass / http://localhost:10180/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://lycheeorg.test/
	ProxyPreserveHost On
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the sites and reload apache:
```bash
sudo a2ensite 001-lychee-test.conf
sudo a2ensite 002-lycheeorg-test.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Apache in the Guest

In your guest OS, clone the Lychee repository (requires ssh key to be set up):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LycheeOrg/Lychee.git /var/www/html/Lychee
git clone git@github.con:LycheeOrg/LycheeOrg.github.io /var/www/html/LycheeOrg.github.io
```

Similarily in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` create 2 configuration files: `001-lychee.conf` and `002-lycheeorg.conf`

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName lychee.test

	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/Lychee/public

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
and
```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName lycheeorg.test

	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/LycheeOrg.github.io

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the sites and reload apache:
```bash
sudo a2ensite 001-lychee-test.conf
sudo a2ensite 002-lycheeorg-test.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Open a browser on your host and navigate to [http://lychee.test][1] and [http://lycheeorg.test][2] enjoy.

### Visual Studio Code

If you use [Visual Studio Code][3], you can use the [remote ssh extension][4]. It will allow you to directly edit your files in your VM without having to upload and download the files.

[1]: http://lychee.test
[2]: http://lycheeorg.test
[3]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[4]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh


## Other means of distributions
