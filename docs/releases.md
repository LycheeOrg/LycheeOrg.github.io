## Version 6

### v6.4.1

Released on Mar 28, 2025

* `fixes` #3152 : Pin tailwind 4.0.6, add cursor feedback on images & others by @ildyria.


### v6.4.0

Released on Mar 23, 2025

#### Mostly a klo release, but a spicy one!

One of the weakness of our codebase was a constant mix between camelCase and snake_case.
This was due to the combination of:
- the database attributes being in snake_case
- the old style php being in snake_case
- some recent contributions being in camelCase
- Matthias and Ildyria are also a enterprise grade developers (understand Java, C++, C#) and we are used to camelCase.

As a result, ppshobi decided to write a rector rule to convert all the code base to a single standard.
After further thoughts, we decided to go with snake_case. This is a bit more verbose, but it is easier to read when you are not use to camelCase.

#### Changes

`SE` refers to functionalities that are aimed at the Supporter Edition.

* `new` #3100 : feat: custom variable casing rector rule to convert camelCase vars to snake_case by @ppshobi.
* `fixes` #3107 : Do not upload placeholders to S3 by @ildyria.
  > The placeholder are base64 encoded directly in the database, as a result, when the jobs uploading 
  > the images to S3, they couldn't find the non-existing images and were crashing.
  > We fixes this.
* `klo` #3104 : Improve baseline by @ildyria.
  > Due to migration to Phpstan v2, we had to reset our baseline.

  > This is may seem a small change, but this means that effectively the album page is loaded behind the photo view.
  > As a result, if you go back from a photo to the album view, you no longer have a scroll down and triggering the
  > loading of all the images (even though they were set to be lazy loaded).
* `SE` #3045: Add favourite support by @ildyria.
  > This is a feature that is only available for our Sponsors. It allows any anonymous users to mark a photo as favourite.
  > This is implemented in a privacy friendly way: the favourite is stored in the local storage of the browser.
  > As a result, the favourite is only available on the browser that marked the photo as favourite (no cross-device communication, no data on the server).

### v6.3.1

Released on Feb 15, 2025

#### Changes

* `fixes` #3006 : catch Error when Redis is crashing and not die in 500... by @ildyria.
  > Mis-configuration of redis cache could crash the server catastrophically. The user had to change their
  > `.env` file into insecure settings in order to be able to debug the issue. Instead we just log the crash
  > in error log and execute the request as expected.

### v6.3.0

Released on Feb 14, 2025

#### Localization Reset !

With the version 6, a lot of the strings were still hard coded in the front-end.
We have now moved all the strings to the back-end and we have had to reset the localization.
This means that all the strings are now in English and you will have to re-translate them.

If you would like to help us have a look at your language files in the `resources/lang` folder and submit a PR.
Please ignore the lychee.php file as it is the Legacy file and will be removed in a future version.

#### Caching for performance improvements

Lychee version 6.3 provides significant performance improvements by adding support for caching the API GET request.
**This feature is disabled by default** and **can be enabled in the settings**.

If you would like to use redis as a cache driver, you can set the following values in your `.env` (or similar):

> `CACHE_DRIVER=redis`
> `REDIS_URL=redis://default:@127.0.0.1:6379`
> `REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1`
> `REDIS_PORT=6379`
> `REDIS_PASSWORD=`

We also recommend that you set in order to retain access to your logs if the redis connection is broken:

> `LOG_VIEWER_CACHE_DRIVER=file`

### v6.0.0

Released on Oct 26, 2024

#### Dropping Livewire for Vue3

When we released version 5, we did not realize how much of a mistake switching to Livewire was.
Lychee's front-end became slow and sluggish, plagued with issues.
Most of the time as a work around, we had to advise users to disable version 5 of the front-end
by setting the environment variable `LIVEWIRE_ENABLED=false`.

With this in mind, at the end of June we came to the conclusion that we needed to build a new front-end from scratch.
We decided to go with Vue3, as it is a more mature framework and has a lot of support. This marks the begining of the Lychee version 6.

For more context on those changes, see our blog posts:

- Jun 25, 2024 - [Livewire performances problems ðŸ“‰](/2024-06-25-performance-problems/)
- Jun 29, 2024 - [The future of Lychee: what is coming next. ðŸš€](/2024-06-29-future-of-lychee/)
- Sep 24, 2024 - [About Lychee API documentation](/2024-09-24-v6-scramble/)


#### Introducing Lychee SE

For the past few years, Lychee has been developed by a [small group of people](https://lycheeorg.dev/support/) who have been working on it in their free time. We are proud to offer this software for free and we will continue to do so. However with time our team has decreased to the point where maintaining Lychee has become a challenge. We have been thinking about ways to keep Lychee alive, to be able to keep providing support, and to add more features.

We have come to the conclusion that we need to add a sponsor tier system. We have extended Lychee with a new version called SE (Supporter Edition) which will be available for our GitHub supporters. This SE version comes with enhanced features and configurations, helping us fund ongoing improvements while offering a bit extra to our supporters. The free version of Lychee will continue to be available but with a more streamlined feature set.

We strongly encourage you to check the full comparison between the [free and supporter edition](https://lycheeorg.dev/get-supporter-edition).  
If you enjoy using Lychee, please consider [supporting us](https://github.com/sponsors/LycheeOrg).

Thank you for helping us keep Lychee alive and growing!

#### Important Docker Changes

If you are consuming Lychee via Docker, you will probably need to update your `docker-compose.yml` file.
In order solve the issue of temporary folders in the container, we added an extra volume `/lychee-tmp` which
by default with the updated `docker-compose.yml` will be mapped to `./lychee/tmp`, see [here](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-Docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

This volume allows you to control the temporary folder and avoid the issue of running out of space in the container.

#### Changes

`SE` refers to functionalities that are aimed at the Supporter Edition.

* `new` #106 : have "Search" on all views by @ildyria.
* `fixes` #126 : Add (optional) lossless rotation by @ildyria.
  > Add the ability to over-write the original image with a temporary backup if the image was rotated.
  > All the smaller sizes are normalized but the original is reverted back.
  > Effectively, this is not lossless rotation, this is just no rotation for the original.
* `fixes` #226 `SE` : Add counters for total pictures and subalbums by @ildyria.
  > We added a statistic page, allowing the users to check how much space they are using
  > and the total number of pictures and album that are in the library.

  > We introduced a quota system, allowing the admin to set a limit on the space used by each user.

* `fixes` #1987 : No space left on device by @ildyria.
  > This error was mostly due to having temporary folders in the containers but without any ability to empty them.
  > We now provide a UI to clean those folders, furthermore, those can now be mapped to a host directory.
* `new` #2082 : SEO optimization 1/3 - Setting `<title>` and `<meta>` tags by @ildyria.
  > The title and meta tag are directly fetched from the album targetted by the link.
* `new` #2086 : Feature request: light theme for Lychee by @ildyria.
  > Lychee now comes also with a Light theme, the user no longer needs to tweak their custom.css
  > as there is now a native support for both dark and light sides.
* `fixes` #2168 : Universal Drag & Drop and Paste to upload no longer work when using Livewire by @ildyria.
  > When moving to version 5, this functionality was lost. We now re-introduce it.
* `fixes` #2194 : Change album cover picture creates a slide show of all the picture after the selected one by @ildyria.
  > Version 5 had this annoying re-rendering of the album when changing the cover picture which was completely messed up.
  > By switching to Vue3, this is now fixed.
* `fixes` #2361 : Image selecting does not work on chrome + MacOS by @ildyria.
  > One of the main complaints of MacOs user was that CTRL was also opening the context menu.
  > We now support the CMD key for MacOs users, this should fix this issue.
* `fixes` #2495 : Inverted date on album tiles with multiple months by @ildyria.
  > We provide the ability to change the order of the dates displayed both in the thumbs and hero on albums, cathering to either user preferences.

  > Read [more](https://lycheeorg.test/2024-09-24-v6-scramble/).

### v5.1.1

Released on Jan 22, 2024

#### Thank you @qwerty287

It is with great regret that we see one of our core contributors leave for personal reasons.
Their critical mind was really appreciated and they will be sorely missed.
We wish them success in all their future endeavors.

#### Import From Dropbox

This functionality is back, you will need to add your token and authorize your app on dropbox.
See more here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/saver

#### Redirection of legacy links

We now provide the possiblity to redirect when using old links such as `https://lychee.test/#albumID/photoID`.
To enable this add `LEGACY_V4_REDIRECT=true` in your `.env`.
Do note that this relies on a javascript hook and therefore page reload.
If you did not share any links that way, leave as is. Default value is `false`.

* `fixes` #2215 : Fix import from Dropbox from Livewire side by @ildyria.

- amazon
- apple
- facebook
- github
- google
- mastodon
- microsoft
- nextcloud

You will need to register your app to those providers and get your client id and secret.
Those should then be placed in your `.env` file. See `.env.example` for templates.

Note that Oauth is only usable once the user exists in Lychee database;

### v5.0.3

Released on Jan 12, 2024

From this version Lychee v5 supports hosting with sub-folders. Please update your `.env` as follows:

- `APP_URL` **must** only contain the hostname up to the Top Level Domain (tld) e.g. .com, .org etc.

If you are using Lychee in a sub folder, specify the path after the tld here in the `APP_DIR` constant.
For example for `https://lychee.test/path/to/lychee`:

- Set `APP_URL=https://lychee.test`
- and `APP_DIR=/path/to/lychee`

### v4.6.0

Released on Sep 04, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

Once the migration is applied, should you wish to rollback, you will need to reset your admin user otherwise it will not be possible to log as admin anymore.

#### Changes

- `new` #1453 : Provide an ASCII fallback for multibyte filenames

- `fixes` #1472 : Fixes major bug with relation to Tag albums 
- `fixes` #1495 : Solve minor bugs in the installation procedure

### v4.5.3

Released on Aug 07, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

- The internal representation of Albums changed with version 4.5.0.  
We strongly recommend that you **BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPDATING**.
- The folder structure changed for images; **please check the required directory permissions**.  
Read more [here  &#187;](https://lycheeorg.dev/docs/#directory-permissions).

#### Changes

- `new` : New ID scheme. Albums and photos are migrated to a new ID scheme. Previously, albums and photos used time-based integer IDs. The new IDs are truly 144bit of randomness encoded in Base64 as a 24-character string; e.g., if your photo had the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/16102925744307/16102927818284` before, it may have the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/GTqZfSso3nPeCnTNW4ovisgC/jM6KkmlK7X0LtVas5MjrHtTO` after the migration. This means, **external links to your albums or photos will stop working.** However, we implemented a redirection service. You can enable/disable the re-direction service under `Settings` > `More` > `legacy_id_redirection`. This gives you time to migrate any external reference to the new IDs. We also generate a log entry every time the redirection service is used. This log contains the legacy and new ID as well as information where the request came from. This may help you with the migration of your external links.

- `new` : New folder structure for images:
    - Deep directory structure.  Instead of all images of a certain kind residing in a single, flat directory (potentially containing thousands of files), we now have two additional two-letter directory levels under each kind (e.g., images are stored as `medium/ba/d0/9a28ec995ead4877dfa1befa2d3b.jpg`).
    - HiDPI (`@2x`) variants now reside in their own directories.
    - `big` has been renamed to `original`.

    Note that this only affects newly added photos; those added in the past are not moved to new locations.  Also, see the note above about directory permissions.

- `new` : Refactoring of the internal architecture and the representation of albums.  While this didn't add any major new features, a number of optimizations have been put in place to speed up various operations, e.g., on installations with many hundreds of albums.  Because this requires a particularly complex database migration, those with existing installations should pay attention to the note above about backing up their database.
- `new` : Refactoring of error handling and reporting.  This should result in more meaningful error messages both in the web front end and in the server logs (instead of the old cryptic "Server error or API not found" messages).
- `new` :Refactoring of the file handling during upload/import.  Instead of using temporary files and (re-)reading them many times, we now rely on file streams.  This not only speeds up processing during upload/import (by around 50% in our tests), but is also an important step towards future support for the use of AWS S3 as image storage.
- `new` : Addedfeatures in the web front end :
    - QR code added in the sharing menu.
    - GPX tracks can be added to albums for displaying together with photos on the map.
    - Drag/drop support added for albums and photos to facilitate more intuitive Move/Merge
- `new` : ZIP compression level can now be changed and the compression can be disabled.
- `new` : Support of Vietnamese language.

  > - Neither is required so if people don't want to set those up then it won't affect the operation of Lychee.
  > - Add admin setting to toggle the notification option, which enables a user level menu item to change their email. This is purely opt-in, so users can clear their email if they don't wish to receive the emails anymore.

Basically, they will no longer be treated as hidden (even though they still won't be findable through browsing; we could address that as well by making the Public smart album, well, public -- I welcome your input if we should, and if so, what to name the config variable to enabled that, other than public_public wink).

  > As known improvements, this code will rotate all images.

### v4.0.6

Released May 26, 2020

- `new` #588 : add an option to the sync command to 're-sync' images that already exist.
  > Since XMP sidecars are now allowed, images with the same checksum will not get
  > updated metadata if the sidecar changes but the checksum remains the same. This
  > adds an optional flag to the `lychee:sync` command that forces existing images
  > with no change in checksum to get updated metadata from XMP files (if they exist).
  > It only updates the image if the metadata read in differs from the metadata that
  > the image aleady has.
- `new` #599 : Added method to get the full path of albums.
  > Specifically in the sharing screen, when albums are sometimes named the same
  > (if they are organized by Year and Month), then it is impossible to tell which
  > album you are actually sharing. This adds the ability to get the album's
  > "full path" and sends it down for the sharing settings.
- `fixes` #596 : Failing xmp file read results in fallback to native exif extraction.
  > If the EXIF succeeds but sidecar fails, it reverts falls into the catch.
- `new` #574 : Support of HEIC files and subsequently convert raw files (e.g. .NEF) into jpeg.
  > if a raw file is imported such as .nef, php-imagick will try to generate a thumbnail jpeg for it.
  > Note that the extension still needs to be added in your advanced settings.
  > 
  > **Important:** Lychee was never meant to convert RAW files such as .nef, .cr2 .arw etc.
  > If you shoot RAW, it is to be able to change *exposure*, *dodge*&*burn*, *crop* etc. later in
  > a proper image processing software such as Lightroom, > Photoshop, Capture One, Luminar, Darktable &hellip;
  > otherwise you better shoot JPEG. Lychee does not intend to provide those functionality.
- `new` #594 : Add debug bar for `dev` install.
  > It is disabled by default, even in debug mode. To enable it, set `DEBUGBAR_ENABLED` to `true` in your `.env` file.
- `new` #579 : Ghostbuster command to clean up dead symlinks.
  > The ghostbuster command also parses the database and see if some symlinks are dead.
  > It will delete the photo from the database in such case.
  > As this behaviour can modify the database, we disable it by default. 
- `new` #577 : Parse additional xmp sidecars files to update metadata.
  > This reads in XMP sidecar files (if they exist).
  > Thankfully, exiftool supports reading in sidecars, so we can use the same
  > technique we're using to read the files. We merge both file and sidecar metadata,
  > taking priority based on user settings (default to prefer image metadata)
- `fixes` #581 : Undefined property errors when migrating from 3.1.6.
  > The missing `license`, `lens` are now taken care off. 
- `fixes` #565 : No Dropbox Import with Lychee 4.0.0.
  > The CSP was a bit too tight, preventing the execution of the script from dropbox.

### v4.0.5

Released May 15, 2020

- `new` #551 : Add RSS module.
  > we provide a RSS feed, available at the `/rss` address.
  > it will contains the last `rss_max_items` (default: 100) over the last `rss_recent_days` (default: 7) days.
- `fixes` #557 : report files not imported by sync.
  > When using the command `lychee:sync` if a file is not imported for some reason, the Log will contains more detailed information instead of just an error message.
- `fixes` #550 : Version 4.0.4 database is not updated.
  > Simply forgot to add the bump version.
- `fixes` #460 : Wrong rotation of photos when imported from server via symlink.
  > thumbnails are now also rotated in the proper direction.

### v4.0.4

Released May 11, 2020

- `new` #543 : More idiot proof safeties (and avoid some 404 errors complaints).
  > - We add a check in the public directory that composer has indeed been run.
  > - We add a check that if apache is being used, the rewrite module is enabled (avoid silly 404 error when redirected to `/install`).
- `new` #541 : Better support for SQLite
  > We create a file in `database/database.sqlite` to avoid issues in the case where some user decides to use this type of database without giving a path. 
- `fixes` #539 : Invalid exif geolocation causes db error
  >  We now check that the latitude is between -90 and 90 degrees, we also check that the longitude is between -180 and 180 degrees. Any other values are discarded.
- `fixes` #533 : Add LYCHEE_UPLOADS_URL to secure-headers.php
  > This allows the use allow images to be loaded from another server (CDN).
- `fixes` #529 : Footer linkable.
  > With the update to Laravel v7, the footer was not html html tags anymore. We fix this. This allows the use of links in the footer, for e.g. legal stuff in Germany.
