## Version 4

### v4.6.1

Released on Oct 08, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

- This update contains a Security Update which fix multiple [XSS vulnerability](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-front/security/advisories/GHSA-cr79-38hg-27gv) and update the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
- This update will drop the API key in favor of Authorization token.
As a result, once the migration is applied the old API token won't work anymore.

#### Changes

* `new` #1489 : Drop page support
  > This functionality was not known by 99.9% of the users of Lychee.
  > We decided to drop its support in favor of more targetted development in the core.
* `new` #1443 : Add user and better structure to session json
* `new` #1153 : Support for multi path on server import
* `fixes` #1508 : Ensure that Admin rights are overloading others
* `fixes` #1366 : Improve config options
* `fixes` #1514 : 32 bits system improved support
  > For 32bit systems and time-based, legacy IDs we must catch failing inserts due to duplicate legacy ID
  > when insertions is running too fast. In the past it was sufficient to check for MySQL error codes 23000
  > and 23005 as integers and then pause for a short period of time.
* `fixes` #1480 : Shared albums should not consider the `require_link` property.
* `new` #1368 : Improve API client usability
* `fixes` #1528 : Improve CSP and fix XSS vulnerability
  > See [advisories](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-front/security/advisories/GHSA-cr79-38hg-27gv)

### v4.6.0

Released on Sep 04, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

Once the migration is applied, should you wish to rollback, you will need to reset your admin user otherwise it will not be possible to log as admin anymore.

#### Changes

- `new` #1453 : Provide an ASCII fallback for multibyte filenames
- `new` #1403 : Use Laravel Auth facade instead of home-brewed authentication layer 
  > This change will prevent the rollback as the Admin now follows proper username - hashed password values in the database (previously was hashed username and hashed value).
- `fixes` #1472 : Fixes major bug with relation to Tag albums 
- `fixes` #1495 : Solve minor bugs in the installation procedure

### v4.5.3

Released on Aug 07, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

- The internal representation of Albums changed with version 4.5.0.  
We strongly recommend that you **BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPDATING**.
- The folder structure changed for images; **please check the required directory permissions**.  
Read more [here  &#187;](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/#directory-permissions).

#### Changes

- `new` : New ID scheme. Albums and photos are migrated to a new ID scheme. Previously, albums and photos used time-based integer IDs. The new IDs are truly 144bit of randomness encoded in Base64 as a 24-character string; e.g., if your photo had the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/16102925744307/16102927818284` before, it may have the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/GTqZfSso3nPeCnTNW4ovisgC/jM6KkmlK7X0LtVas5MjrHtTO` after the migration. This means, **external links to your albums or photos will stop working.** However, we implemented a redirection service. You can enable/disable the re-direction service under `Settings` > `More` > `legacy_id_redirection`. This gives you time to migrate any external reference to the new IDs. We also generate a log entry every time the redirection service is used. This log contains the legacy and new ID as well as information where the request came from. This may help you with the migration of your external links.

- `new` : New folder structure for images:
    - Deep directory structure.  Instead of all images of a certain kind residing in a single, flat directory (potentially containing thousands of files), we now have two additional two-letter directory levels under each kind (e.g., images are stored as `medium/ba/d0/9a28ec995ead4877dfa1befa2d3b.jpg`).
    - HiDPI (`@2x`) variants now reside in their own directories.
    - `big` has been renamed to `original`.

    Note that this only affects newly added photos; those added in the past are not moved to new locations.  Also, see the note above about directory permissions.

- `new` : Refactoring of the internal architecture and the representation of albums.  While this didn't add any major new features, a number of optimizations have been put in place to speed up various operations, e.g., on installations with many hundreds of albums.  Because this requires a particularly complex database migration, those with existing installations should pay attention to the note above about backing up their database.
- `new` : Refactoring of error handling and reporting.  This should result in more meaningful error messages both in the web front end and in the server logs (instead of the old cryptic "Server error or API not found" messages).
- `new` :Refactoring of the file handling during upload/import.  Instead of using temporary files and (re-)reading them many times, we now rely on file streams.  This not only speeds up processing during upload/import (by around 50% in our tests), but is also an important step towards future support for the use of AWS S3 as image storage.
- `new` : Addedfeatures in the web front end :
    - QR code added in the sharing menu.
    - GPX tracks can be added to albums for displaying together with photos on the map.
    - Drag/drop support added for albums and photos to facilitate more intuitive Move/Merge
- `new` : ZIP compression level can now be changed and the compression can be disabled.
- `new` : Support of Vietnamese language.

  > - It is set to send out emails once a week via cron, so the laravel cron job would need to be set up.
  > - Neither is required so if people don't want to set those up then it won't affect the operation of Lychee.
  > - Add admin setting to toggle the notification option, which enables a user level menu item to change their email. This is purely opt-in, so users can clear their email if they don't wish to receive the emails anymore.
  > - The email that gets sent out has been branded lychee, and will group the last week's worth of notifications and send them all out in one email to each user that has an email set up.

If set to 0, photos individually made public (rather than through an album) will be included in the results of a public search or in public tagged albums. Basically, they will no longer be treated as hidden (even though they still won't be findable through browsing; we could address that as well by making the Public smart album, well, public -- I welcome your input if we should, and if so, what to name the config variable to enabled that, other than public_public wink).

  >  By adding nested set tree, column `_lft` and `_rgt` did not exist on first import while the code required it.
- `new` #919 : Add the possibility to limit the number of image being processed
  > This will lower the memory load on the server, especially on RAM limited instances.

  > - Changing this property is either done on clicking on the star or toggling it in the visibility parameters.
  > - makes it possible to hide Sensitive folder by default.
  >

### v4.0.6

Released May 26, 2020

- `new` #588 : add an option to the sync command to 're-sync' images that already exist.
  > Since XMP sidecars are now allowed, images with the same checksum will not get
  > updated metadata if the sidecar changes but the checksum remains the same. This
  > adds an optional flag to the `lychee:sync` command that forces existing images
  > with no change in checksum to get updated metadata from XMP files (if they exist).
  > It only updates the image if the metadata read in differs from the metadata that
  > the image aleady has.
- `new` #599 : Added method to get the full path of albums.
  > Specifically in the sharing screen, when albums are sometimes named the same
  > (if they are organized by Year and Month), then it is impossible to tell which
  > album you are actually sharing. This adds the ability to get the album's
  > "full path" and sends it down for the sharing settings.
- `fixes` #596 : Failing xmp file read results in fallback to native exif extraction.
  > If the EXIF succeeds but sidecar fails, it reverts falls into the catch.
- `new` #574 : Support of HEIC files and subsequently convert raw files (e.g. .NEF) into jpeg.
  > if a raw file is imported such as .nef, php-imagick will try to generate a thumbnail jpeg for it.
  > Note that the extension still needs to be added in your advanced settings.
  > 
  > **Important:** Lychee was never meant to convert RAW files such as .nef, .cr2 .arw etc.
  > If you shoot RAW, it is to be able to change *exposure*, *dodge*&*burn*, *crop* etc. later in
  > a proper image processing software such as Lightroom, > Photoshop, Capture One, Luminar, Darktable &hellip;
  > otherwise you better shoot JPEG. Lychee does not intend to provide those functionality.
- `new` #594 : Add debug bar for `dev` install.
  > It is disabled by default, even in debug mode. To enable it, set `DEBUGBAR_ENABLED` to `true` in your `.env` file.
- `new` #579 : Ghostbuster command to clean up dead symlinks.
  > The ghostbuster command also parses the database and see if some symlinks are dead.
  > It will delete the photo from the database in such case.
  > As this behaviour can modify the database, we disable it by default. 
- `new` #577 : Parse additional xmp sidecars files to update metadata.
  > This reads in XMP sidecar files (if they exist).
  > Thankfully, exiftool supports reading in sidecars, so we can use the same
  > technique we're using to read the files. We merge both file and sidecar metadata,
  > taking priority based on user settings (default to prefer image metadata)
- `fixes` #581 : Undefined property errors when migrating from 3.1.6.
  > The missing `license`, `lens` are now taken care off. 
- `fixes` #565 : No Dropbox Import with Lychee 4.0.0.
  > The CSP was a bit too tight, preventing the execution of the script from dropbox.

### v4.0.5

Released May 15, 2020

- `new` #551 : Add RSS module.
  > we provide a RSS feed, available at the `/rss` address.
  > it will contains the last `rss_max_items` (default: 100) over the last `rss_recent_days` (default: 7) days.
- `fixes` #557 : report files not imported by sync.
  > When using the command `lychee:sync` if a file is not imported for some reason, the Log will contains more detailed information instead of just an error message.
- `fixes` #550 : Version 4.0.4 database is not updated.
  > Simply forgot to add the bump version.
- `fixes` #460 : Wrong rotation of photos when imported from server via symlink.
  > thumbnails are now also rotated in the proper direction.

### v4.0.4

Released May 11, 2020

- `new` #543 : More idiot proof safeties (and avoid some 404 errors complaints).
  > - We add a check in the public directory that composer has indeed been run.
  > - We add a check that if apache is being used, the rewrite module is enabled (avoid silly 404 error when redirected to `/install`).
- `new` #541 : Better support for SQLite
  > We create a file in `database/database.sqlite` to avoid issues in the case where some user decides to use this type of database without giving a path. 
- `fixes` #539 : Invalid exif geolocation causes db error
  >  We now check that the latitude is between -90 and 90 degrees, we also check that the longitude is between -180 and 180 degrees. Any other values are discarded.
- `fixes` #533 : Add LYCHEE_UPLOADS_URL to secure-headers.php
  > This allows the use allow images to be loaded from another server (CDN).
- `fixes` #529 : Footer linkable.
  > With the update to Laravel v7, the footer was not html html tags anymore. We fix this. This allows the use of links in the footer, for e.g. legal stuff in Germany.
- `fixes` #525 : The config from the v3 was not migrated
  > We now also migrates most of the configuration from the v3 if the `lychee_settings` table if found.


### v4.0.3

Released April 29, 2020

- `fixes` #498 remove Lychee-front version number alltogether
  > add Diagnostic information:
  > 
  > - Composer install type
  > - release type (git vs release)
  > - add button to allow migration for users using the release channel instead of master.
- `fixes` #508
  > Diagnostic was checking the existence of mysqli only if postgresql is not used. With the added support of SQLite we now thoroughly check each possibilities.
- `fixes` #510
  > add SQLite3 to the travis build check.

### v4.0.2

Released April 22, 2020

  > Error in the migration which made the script some files were existing.
- `fixes` #485
  > Align lychee-front version number, remove error when not provided.

  > Allows the user to have a landing page instead of directly arriving at the gallery if enabled.
- `new` : Image symbolic module
  > To prevent full pictures from being directly available, a module is available to make the image link hard to guess. *This will induce a slow down when the image is generated*
- `new` : use XCRF cookies
  > All requests to the server require an encrypted cookie in order to prevent cross-site request forgeries.
- `new` : *"one click update"*
  > Admins can update their installation in one click in the Diagnostic interface if their installation has been done with `git`.
