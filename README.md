# Token usage to Bypass CSRF

* What is CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that forces a user’s browser to perform unwanted actions on a web application in which the user is authenticated. In simpler terms, CSRF exploits the trust a web application has in a user's browser.

*  How CSRF Works

When you're logged into a website, your browser automatically sends your session cookies with every request to that website. An attacker can take advantage of this by tricking your browser into sending a malicious request to the website you’re logged into, using your cookies, and thereby performing actions without your consent.

* What is CSRF Tokens


A CSRF token (Cross-Site Request Forgery token) is a unique, secret value generated by a server and included in web forms or API requests. It is used to protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that every state-changing request (like form submissions or API calls) comes from the legitimate user and not from a third party (attacker).

* How CSRF Tokens Work

When a user visits a web page or form:

1) Token Generation: The server generates a unique, random token and stores it in the user’s session.
2) Embedding in Forms: The token is sent to the user’s browser, usually embedded as a hidden field in HTML forms or included in HTTP headers.
3) Sending the Token: When the user submits the form or sends an API request, the CSRF token is included as part of the request.
4) Token Validation: The server checks if the token sent in the request matches the token stored in the user’s session. If they match, the request is processed. If they don’t match, the server rejects the request, preventing potential attacks.

Using CSRF tokens is essential to secure your web application against unauthorized actions. By generating unique tokens for each session and validating them with every request, you can prevent attackers from exploiting your site through CSRF attacks. Properly embedding and verifying tokens in forms and API requests ensures that all actions are legitimate and originate from trusted sources.
