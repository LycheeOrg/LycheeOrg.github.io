### About

Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The LycheeOrg contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Lychee effectively, productively, and respectfully. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the LycheeOrg team. This includes the issue tracker, our discord and any other communication channels created by the project team.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting one of our admin team on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JMPvuRQcTf).

### Lychee values
These are the values to which people in the Lychee community (“Lychee users”) should aspire.

- **Be friendly and welcoming.**
- **Be patient.**
    - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
- **Be thoughtful.**
    - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- **Be respectful.**
    - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- **Be charitable.**
    - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
    - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- **Be constructive.**
    - Avoid derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    - Avoid unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    - Avoid snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).
    - Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
    - Avoid microaggressions (brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group).
- **Be responsible.**
    - What you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of *all parties* to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

### Code of Conduct

#### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

#### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

#### Our Responsibilities

Lychee maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Lychee maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#### Conflict Resolution

We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.

If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

Reports should be directed to the Lychee maintainers on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JMPvuRQcTf). It is the Lychee maintainers’ duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.

#### Summary

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please contact us directly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JMPvuRQcTf).
