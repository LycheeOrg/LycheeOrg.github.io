In the past few days I have been working on the final touches, trying to check all the corners.
The dropdown to select the hero picture is back, and the selection of tags on tag albums is also working.

![Configuration of JS and CSS](/blog/v6/20241005-2.png)
I added back the boxes to edit Css and JS so that users are able to customize the look and feel of Lychee as they wish.

I also added back import from dropbox. I removed it in the version 5, but we got some complaints that it was missing and had to add it back.
This time, I took the proactive approach to directly integrate it from the start. Note that the code is not much tested in that corner as I do not use Dropbox.

That being said, today I added a new functionality. It was often requested to have a *"real"* slideshow mode.
This is now the case ðŸ˜ƒ. You can trigger it by tapping your Space bar or clicking the play button in the header.
Your *Left* and *Right* arrow keys allow you to switch to the next picture. Otherwise, just let the timer run
out and the next picture will be loaded automatically.

The behaviour is very similar to the frame mode. The later is aimed to be used in a screen display and rotate randomly.
In the case of the slideshow, the pictures will be displayed in order of the current album.

With this in the box, it is time to announce that the Beta is now ready. You can access it either via the `alpha` tag on docker,
or via the [release page](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.1).

As opposed to the alpha, the beta will bump your version number to 6.0.0.

Feedback on the version 6 with the new front-end are welcomed on [GitHub](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/discussions/2556) or our [dicord](https://discord.gg/JMPvuRQcTf).
