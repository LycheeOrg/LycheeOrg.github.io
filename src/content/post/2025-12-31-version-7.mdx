## 2025: A Year of Innovation and Growth for Lychee

As we close out 2025, we're thrilled to celebrate another milestone year for Lychee! Our journey this year has been marked by significant technical achievements, expanded functionality, and a deepened commitment to our community. Throughout the year, we've shipped an impressive 41 releases packed with new features, performance improvements, and important security fixes. From introducing Flow (a social-friendly feed-like display) and Timeline views to adding powerful tools like watermarking, zip upload support, and the Renamer module, we've continuously enhanced what Lychee can do for photographers.

We welcomed a new reviewer, [@JasonMillward](https://github.com/JasonMillward), who has been instrumental in maintaining code quality and ensuring that every release meets our high standards. We also had the pleasure of welcoming new contributor [@cdzombak](https://github.com/cdzombak), who brought fantastic UX improvements including pinned albums, embedded galleries with video support, and numerous usability enhancements.

Security remained a priority with multiple SSRF vulnerability fixes, ensuring your self-hosted gallery stays safe. The foundation we built through tags refactoring, user groups, Flow and Sync improvements, and multiple admin support has culminated in our most ambitious release yet: Version 7.

### Version 7: Our Most Ambitious Release Yet

Version 7 marks a major architectural shift for Lychee. Our Docker release is now powered by FrankenPHP with Laravel Octane instead of the traditional nginx + PHP-FPM stack. This infrastructure keeps the framework in memory and reuses components across requests, eliminating the overhead of rebuilding the entire application on every page load. As a result, boot time drops from 40-60ms to just 4-6ms per request, with 3-4x better throughput and significantly reduced latency.

In May 2025, FrankenPHP gained official support from the PHP Foundation, cementing its position as the future of high-performance PHP applications.

The new FrankenPHP-powered Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/lycheeorg/lychee:edge` and will become the default once version 7 is fully stable.

This architectural change means you will need to update your Docker setup when upgrading from version 6 to version 7 with FrankenPHP. Please refer to our [upgrade documentation](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/upgrade.html) for detailed instructions.

#### Performance Revolution

In addition to changing the PHP engine, we've implemented several key performance optimizations:

- **Asymmetric Processing**: Intelligent parallel processing for photo imports, slashing the time needed to upload and process large photo collections
- **Album Loading Optimization**: Deep refactoring of our codebase to handle large albums with grace, ensuring smooth browsing even with thousands of photos

#### New Features That Matter

**Star Rating System**: We listened to your feedback! Users can now rate their photos from 1 to 5 stars. In the future, we will be adding smart albums related to ratings, filters, and more. Whether you're a professional photographer curating a portfolio or simply want to mark your favorites, this feature puts powerful organization tools at your fingertips to showcase your best work.

**Webshop**: The biggest feature addition of 2025! After 6 months of intensive development, we're proud to introduce our fully-integrated webshop solution. This game-changing feature enables photographers to:
- Sell prints, digital downloads, and photo products directly through Lychee
- Process payments seamlessly via Mollie, PayPal, or offline methods
- Manage product catalogs
- Handle orders from creation through fulfillment

The Webshop empowers photographers to monetize their work without leaving their Lychee galleries, opening new revenue streams and simplifying the sales process. This feature is exclusive to Lychee Pro users.

As a thank you to our loyal supporters, we've granted Lychee Pro access to all existing supporters at the $10/month tier or higher. This is our way of recognizing the community that makes Lychee possible.

### Looking Ahead

The innovations in Version 7 lay the groundwork for even more exciting developments. Our commitment remains unchanged: building the best self-hosted photo management/portfolio solution while respecting your privacy and giving you complete control over your images.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making 2025 such an extraordinary year for Lychee. Here's to another year of innovation, community, and beautiful photography!
