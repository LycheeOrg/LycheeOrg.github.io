First of all, I apologize for the silence over the past few months.
Nevertheless, just because I was not posting does not mean I wasnâ€™t working on Lychee, as shown by the multiple releases since then: 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6, including several intermediate patches.

Six months ago, I wrote a [post](https://lycheeorg.dev/2024-12-13-what-is-next/) about the future of Lychee and my vision for it.
Looking at the todo list I wrote back then, one might think that we have not accomplished much.
The main reason is that, rather than rushing to add many features that might break often,
Lychee focuses on stability and quality. We want to ensure that the foundations are solid before adding new features.
This is why we have been focusing on the `Must have` items:

- User groups have been implemented. Integration with access control is still pending, but coming soon.
- Improved integration with OAuth and SSO.
- Permission propagation has been implemented.
- Mass sharing v4 has been implemented, allowing users to share multiple albums and photos on a single page.
- Settings have been completely refactored with a new layout, allowing grouping and hiding complexity.
- Localization has been completely reset and improved. We now support Weblate, allowing anyone to contribute translations.
- The previous, unstable implementation of random links has been replaced with a stronger and safer one using AES and signatures.
- We have added live statistics, allowing users to see the number of visits, shares, downloads, and more.

None of this would have been possible without the feedback from our users and the help of our supporters.
We are very grateful for your support and patience.

We are also very happy to see our small team growing with the addition of Sancsin, Ppshobi, Jason, and Ronnie.
