It has been a week since the release of the beta and I do get questions such as "*when will we see a production build?*""

This an hard to answer question. One one hand, we could merge the changes and ship 6.0.0 today.
Why don't we do it? Because there has not been a thorough review process on it the [Pull Request #2504](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/pull/2504) yet.

At LycheeOrg we strive for quality, and while I am confident in my abilities, everyone has a blind spot.
For this reason, I am waiting for the feedback of our Beta users, in order to fix their findings.

Over the past week, I got a lot of feedback from Tino Hager (big thanks), so I still have a few things to work on, namely:

- [ ] : rotation - refresh visual.
- [ ] : Album selection when only one album exists => edge case list is empty.
- [ ] : Drag & drop photo.
- [ ] : Ctrl + V pasting photos to upload.
- [ ] : Upload button when album is empty.

I already solved a lot of his previous notes, and will happily continue doing it again in the future.

Now to the question, can I already use the docker `alpha` branch in production?
I am doing it, but I know lychee like the palm of my hand, YMMV. :)
