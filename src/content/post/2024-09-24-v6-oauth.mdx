Added first in version 5, it is also now available in version 6. I have not fully tested the code
but I am quite confident it works as expected (as it is literally the same as on version 5).

Furthermore, as the keycloak is making use of the `fa-key` icon, we switched the WebAuthn icon to 
`fa-fingerprint` to avoid confusion. Furthermore, with biometrics rolling out such as face-id and
fingerprint readers in WebAuthn authentication devices, it also makes more sense to use this icon
(first one from left to right on the row of icons in the screenshot below).
