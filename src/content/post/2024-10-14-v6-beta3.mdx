I got some nice and extensive feedback from Beta 1.
See below the fixes and improvements that have been made in the Beta 2.

- [x] : Fix pictures not being deleted when clicked on the button.
- [x] : Fix links and bold which were invisible in light mode in Album and Photo descriptions
- [x] : Add link shape check on Upload via Url
- [x] : Dropbox upload is now set to `disabled` if it was empty, no more useless warning in Diagnostics.
- [x] : Import from server is gone from the menu (it was already gone in v5).
- [x] : Some labels have been updated for readability.
- [x] : Added a button in the middle of the screen when the album is empty to prompt the upload of pictures.
- [x] : Drag & Drop fixed on Upload + Full drag & drop support on album pages + Paste image support as upload on album pages.
- [x] : Ongoing progress of uploads is now displayed on top of the modal.
- [x] : Added tooltips on the action bar for photos (star, rotate, delete)
- [x] : In slideshow the actions buttons for photos were still visible (though unusable).
- [x] : Fixed the Edit photo dialog for consistent design.
- [x] : Improved visibility form in Albums.
- [x] : Add set as album header button in photo view
- [x] : Rotating a photo refreshes the photo.
- [x] : Added setting to preserve photo on upload when auto rotation is set.
- [x] : Added swipe left / right to switch picture.
- [x] : Added scroll up / down to switch picture.
- [x] : Fixed some Warnings as Info in Diagnostics.
- [x] : Fixed broken images on thumbs
- [x] : After upload is completed, refresh album in the background
- [x] : Switching from dark mode to light mode and vice-versa no longer requires reloading.
- [x] : Fixed Photo details colors in light mode.
- [x] : Do not show the Map when Map settings is disabled.
- [x] : Fixes error messages showing up full screen when `dist/user.css` and `dist/custom.js` do not exist.
- [x] : Add `GET api/v2/Photo::random` end point to request random pictures, this provides the full data of the photo instead of the src links for the frame.
- [x] : Revamped completely the User Management panel.

With this out of the pipe, it is now time to release a [new Beta version](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.2).
And as always, the Docker `alpha` tag reflects the latest changes to Version 6.
