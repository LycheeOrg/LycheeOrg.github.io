Now that most of the ground work has been built, we focus on the smaller details.
We add back what all gallery should have: the uploader.
And just like in the version 5 it supports chunk upload and parallel processing.

Once completed the list stays open (for now).

A nice improvement that could be added later: cancelling an upload.
But there are more pressing matters.

Also added the menu in the top right to access the usual creations options.

What is left to be done before we start having a viable prototype?
Still quite a bit see the list below.

- Create/Move/Merge/Delete albums via context menu
- Copy/Delete/Star etc. photo via context menu
- Editing picture informations
- Frame/Slideshow view
- Map view
- U2F
- Oauth
- All existing key bindings
- Sharing summary page (nice to have).
