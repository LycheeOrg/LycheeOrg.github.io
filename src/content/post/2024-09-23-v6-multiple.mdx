While I am quite busy, I still try to push the development and I hope to be able to release a beta of version 6 by the end of the week.

### Thumb album decorations

As you can see on the screenshot above, the album decorations are making their come back from the version 4 (I hadn't had time to implement them in v5).
You know have the choice between:
- `layer` (default),
- `photos` (number of photos), 
- `albums` (number of sub albums),
- `all` (number of photos and albums),
- and `none` which hides the indicator.

When using `all` the direction and order of appearance are also configurable.

### Context menu improvements

### WebAuthn support

Furthermore, this weekend I have been actively working on the WebAuthn authentication method.
All behaviours are now functionals.

Listing is also available with the ability to edit the aliases.
For less opacity, we also provide the registration datetime of key material.

And if you try to register a key that is already in the database, we also prevent this.

### What is left?

On the todo list before we can go t

### Can I test this already ?

Sure! There are multiple ways:
- there is now an [alpha prerelease](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases/tag/v6.0.0-alpha1) archive but it is more of a snapshot of current development.
- You can try to follow the `alpha` branch on Lychee (though once the v6 will be published, don't forget to switch pack to `master`)
- You can also use the `alpha` tag on docker releases. It is building the latest version of `alpha` branch every night.

**Important:** we do not support bug report yet as those are advanced development build and not production ready.
To put it bluntly: **If things break, you are on your own. Don't come crying.**
