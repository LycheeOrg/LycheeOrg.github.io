One of the complaints we got a few times was that the Gallery link in top right was not so visible.
We now also provide a big link in the middle of the page with a subtle tripple arrow annimation to catch the eye with movement.
Hopefully this resolves some of the requests.

As it was disabled in version 5, import from server is not coming back in version 6. Sorry.
Still in order to avoid questions "where did this go?" etc, we provide a kind reminder to the user that the functionality is no more.

I am currently working on the dialogs to create Albums.
