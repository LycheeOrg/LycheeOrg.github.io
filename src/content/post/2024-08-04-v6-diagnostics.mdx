A bit of refactoring on the Profile page.
Note that there is a change in behaviour:

- for any changes, the old password is required. This is to ensure that the email address or the username are not changed by mistake.
- username and email are now pre-filled.
- This is a single API call instead of two as in v4 and v5.

After that we focused on adding back a quite important page: the Diagnostics.
All sections are there: Errors (also available when not logged in), Info, Space and Configuration.
As usual, the button to request space usage, as this one tend to be pretty slow on some installations.
