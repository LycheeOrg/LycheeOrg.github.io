More work on the More tabs. We now display a warning that some changes have not been saved.
When clicked on Save, a toast notification confirms that the data has been properly persisted.

We also add a warning for the version field. This one should not be edited as it will mess up with the migrations of the database.

We also added a small indicator of which field have been modified. Clicking on that indicator reset the field to its previous value.
