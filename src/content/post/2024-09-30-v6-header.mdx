In my previous post, I mentionned I was not happy with the header, especially on mobile devices. I am happy to say that I found a nice compromise.

<div class="flex gap-2 -my-5">
<div>
![in mobile view](/blog/v6/20240930-2.png)
</div>
<div>
![in mobile view menu open](/blog/v6/20240930-3.png)
</div>
</div>

When switching the mobile, the long title is replaced by "Albums" and all the buttons are placed in a speed dial menu.

Similarly when logged out.
<div class="flex gap-2 -my-10">
<div class="w-4/6">
![in mobile view](/blog/v6/20240930-4.png)
</div>
<div class="w-2/6">
![in mobile view](/blog/v6/20240930-5.png)
</div>
</div>
The *"Return to home"* Link is replaced with a house button and the long title replaced by the translated Albums.

After checking most of the functions, I noticed that we are still missing the followings:

- [ ] The support of gps tracks
- [ ] The selection of header image in albums (plus misc I may have forgotten).
- [ ] Easy set/unset of visible smart albums (and probably fix some v5 bugs in the *unsorted* one).
- [ ] The support of Dropbox
- [ ] More easy to the eye in the Settings page.
