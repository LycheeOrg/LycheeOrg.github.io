More things start to takes shape. The selection with Ctrl and Shift are now working.
The Drag-and-select is not implemented yet, but that one will probably be for after the official release.
So far the interface is still not mobile friendly for selection, some improvements needs to be made here.
I also need to check how the interaction with ctrl + click is working on Mac to see if that is still spawning a browser context menu.

That being said, the first few operations are now *working*. The photo listing is are updated yet, nor dropping the local cache of the
current album. Ah, I forgot to mention that.

As opposed to version 4 and version 5, Lychee v6 will support local caching of the requests, which means that once an album has been 
open once, it will not be queried again. This will significantly speed up the responses when going through multiple pages etc.
On the less fun size for me, it also means that I will be fighting against the cache invalidation problem. Wish me luck. ;)

That being said, now that photo selection is working, we also have the context menus being displayed. At the moment most of the actions
are empty placeholders, but actual execution code should be coming soon.
