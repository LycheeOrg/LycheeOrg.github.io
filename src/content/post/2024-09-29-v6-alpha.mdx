A week ago I did a list (see [here](/2024-09-23-v6-multiple)) of things that needed to be completed before we could move further. After battling to get back the code coverage above 80%, I was able to finish the needed tick box. This also includes some missed points such as the unlocking of albums with passwords and sensitive curtains.

I would say Lychee v6 is very close to be ready. For this reason we are publishing a second alpha release.

However after a few more tests, I couldn't help but notice that there are a few problems needed to be fixed:

- [ ] Header bar on mobile phones, including menu links
- [ ] Dynamic menu buttons in header when selecting pictures or albums.
- [ ] More things that I may have missed? 
  
Anyway, if you are interested in giving a try to this second Alpha release, check it [here](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases/tag/v6.0.0-alpha3) or the alpha tag on our docker.
