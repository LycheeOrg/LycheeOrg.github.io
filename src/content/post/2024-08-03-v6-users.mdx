After the settings we now focus on User managment.
We added the following endpoints, including tests:

- `/Users` ✅
- `/Users::save` ✅
- `/Users::delete` ✅
- `/Users::create` ✅

And the associated VueJS components for the front-end:

- create user ✅
- edit user ✅
- delete user ✅

The page is now fully functional on laptops.

And view in Mobile. The buttons are simplified for icons.
